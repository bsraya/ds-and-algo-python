## 3. Linked Lists

### 3.1 What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a data structure used for storing collections of data. A linked list has the following properties:
* Sucessive elements are connected by pointers
* The last element points to NULL
* It can grow or shrink in size during execution of a progeam
* It can be made just as long as it is required (until system memory exhausts)
* It does not waste memory space, yet it takes some extra memory for pointers
